Say hello to my first Kicad project... Time to wean myself off eagle.


Multiple Address Decoder replacement for U15 in C64


This is a D100, D200, D300, D500, D600 & D700 adapter board based on the schematics from Maciej Witkowiak @ https://github.com/ytmytm/c64-ciaide

Goes into a C64 longboard, replacing the 74LS138 at location U15.

These are ready for production at JLCPCB including the 3 surface mount parts. (2x74ls138s and a .1uf cap).

All you need for components are pinheaders for the motherboard socket, and then you can either solder on your wires to the output, or add header pins.

Thanks for Retro Tech Insanity (https://www.youtube.com/@retrotechinsanity3164) for the inspiration.
